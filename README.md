# NeighborFit - Neighborhood Lifestyle Matching Application

## Project Overview

NeighborFit is a full-stack Java web application that solves the neighborhood-lifestyle matching problem through systematic research, data analysis, and algorithmic thinking. The application matches users with neighborhoods based on their lifestyle preferences, demographic characteristics, and location requirements.

## Problem Analysis & Research

### Core Problem Definition
The neighborhood-lifestyle matching problem involves finding the optimal neighborhood for individuals based on their:
- **Lifestyle Preferences**: Hobbies, family status, pet preferences, transportation choices
- **Demographic Alignment**: Age, income, education, occupation compatibility
- **Location Requirements**: Commute time, walkability, transit access, budget constraints

### Research Methodology
1. **User Research**: Analyzed common relocation patterns and decision factors
2. **Market Analysis**: Studied existing solutions (Zillow, Redfin, Niche) and identified gaps
3. **Data Validation**: Used real neighborhood data to validate matching hypotheses
4. **Algorithm Testing**: Iteratively refined matching criteria based on user feedback

### Key Findings
- Users prioritize different factors based on life stage and family status
- Walkability and safety scores significantly impact neighborhood satisfaction
- Budget constraints often override other preferences
- Transportation options are crucial for urban vs. suburban preferences

### Matching Algorithm Design

#### Algorithm Components
1. **Lifestyle Compatibility (40%)**
   - Family status alignment
   - Pet preference compatibility
   - Transportation mode support
   - Hobby and amenity matching

2. **Demographic Alignment (30%)**
   - Age compatibility with neighborhood median
   - Income level matching
   - Education level correlation
   - Occupation type considerations

3. **Location & Transportation (30%)**
   - Commute time requirements
   - Walkability scores
   - Transit accessibility
   - Location type preferences

#### Scoring Methodology
```java
// Weighted scoring system
double overallScore = (lifestyleScore * 0.4) + 
                     (demographicScore * 0.3) + 
                     (locationScore * 0.3);

// Normalized to 0-100 scale
overallScore = Math.min(100.0, Math.max(0.0, overallScore * 100));
```

#### Match Strength Classification
- **Excellent (90-100)**: Highly recommended
- **Very Good (80-89)**: Strongly recommended
- **Good (70-79)**: Recommended
- **Fair (60-69)**: Consider with caution
- **Poor (0-59)**: Not recommended

### Data Processing Pipeline

#### Data Sources
- **Census API**: Demographic and economic data
- **Walk Score API**: Walkability and transit scores
- **Crime Data**: Safety statistics
- **School Ratings**: Educational quality metrics

#### Data Challenges & Solutions
1. **Missing Data**: Implemented fallback values and interpolation
2. **Data Inconsistencies**: Normalized values across different sources
3. **Geographic Boundaries**: Used ZIP code and coordinate-based matching
4. **Real-time Updates**: Scheduled data refresh mechanisms

### API Design

#### REST Endpoints
```
POST   /api/users/register              # User registration
GET    /api/users/{userId}              # Get user profile
PUT    /api/users/{userId}              # Update user profile
POST   /api/matching/users/{userId}/matches  # Find matches
GET    /api/matching/users/{userId}/history  # Match history
GET    /api/matching/analytics          # System analytics

## Systems Thinking & Scalability

### Trade-offs & Decision Rationale

#### Database Choice
- **H2 (Development)**: Fast startup, in-memory for demo
- **Production**: PostgreSQL for scalability and ACID compliance
- **Trade-off**: Development simplicity vs. production robustness

#### Algorithm Complexity
- **Current**: O(n*m) where n=users, m=neighborhoods
- **Optimization**: Implemented candidate filtering to reduce search space
- **Future**: Consider spatial indexing for geographic queries
